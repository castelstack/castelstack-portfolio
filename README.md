## Live Demo

## Technologies Used

Next.js: Next.js is a powerful React framework that allows for server-side rendering and easy creation of fast and scalable web applications.

AOS (Animate On Scroll): AOS is a lightweight library for animating elements on scroll. It adds beautiful fade-in and slide-up animations to make the user experience more engaging.

Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that helps in rapid UI development. It provides a set of utility classes that allow for easy styling and customization.

Axios: Axios is a popular promise-based HTTP client used for making API requests. It enables seamless communication with external APIs.

## Features

Responsive Design: The website is designed to provide an optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes.

Animated Transitions: AOS adds smooth animations to various sections of the website, creating an attractive and user-friendly interface.

GitHub Repositories: The website consumes the GitHub API to display a list of my repositories, providing visitors with insights into my coding projects.

About Me: A dedicated section provides visitors with a brief introduction to myself, my background, and my passion for web development.

Project Showcase: I showcase my personal and professional projects with details, descriptions, and live links (if applicable).

Skills & Technologies: I list the programming languages, frameworks, and tools I am proficient in, emphasizing my expertise to potential employers or collaborators.

Contact Form: The contact form allows visitors to get in touch with me directly, making it easy for potential clients or employers to reach out.

## Husky and Commitlint Rules

In our project, we use Husky and Commitlint to enforce consistent commit message formats. The following rules are applied to commit messages:

```bash
- **type-enum** or **type-case**: Specifies the allowed commit types and their case. The commit types should be one of the following:

  - feat: A new feature
  - fix: A bug fix
  - chore: Maintenance or build-related changes
  - docs: Documentation changes
  - style: Code style changes
  - refactor: Code refactoring
  - test: Testing-related changes

- **scope-enum**: Specifies the allowed commit scopes. The commit scopes should be one of the following:

  - app: Application-specific changes
  - server: Server-specific changes
  - docs: Documentation-related changes
  - config: Configuration changes

- **subject-max-length**: The maximum length for the commit subject is 50 characters.

- **body-max-line-length**: Each line in the commit body should not exceed 72 characters.

- **subject-empty**: The commit subject should not be empty.

- **footer-max-line-length**: Each line in the commit footer should not exceed 72 characters.
```

By following these rules, we ensure that commit messages are consistent and provide clear information about the changes made in each commit.

Please ensure that your commit messages adhere to these rules when making commits to the repository.

For more details about the configuration and customization of these rules, refer to the `commitlint.config.js` file in the root of the project.
